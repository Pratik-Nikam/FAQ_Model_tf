To apply SMOTE when you have categorical data like "Description" (text) and "Flavor" (labels), we need to:

1. Convert text descriptions into numerical features (e.g., using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer).


2. Apply SMOTE to balance the flavors.


3. Convert the oversampled data back into a usable format.



Here's how you can do it:

Applying SMOTE for Text Data

import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample DataFrame (replace with your actual dataset)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Description': ["Sweet and tangy", "Rich and creamy", "Bitter with a hint of citrus", 
                    "Mild and smooth", "Strong and spicy", "Sweet and fruity"],  
    'Flavor': ["Citrus", "Vanilla", "Bitter", "Mild", "Spicy", "Fruity"]
})

# Assuming you have a large dataset, replace df with your actual data
X_text = df["Description"]  # Text data
y = df["Flavor"]  # Target labels (flavors)

# Convert text descriptions into numerical features using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_text)

# Check class distribution before SMOTE
print("Class distribution before SMOTE:", Counter(y))

# Apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_vectorized, y)

# Convert back to DataFrame
df_resampled = pd.DataFrame(X_resampled.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
df_resampled["Flavor"] = y_resampled

# Check class distribution after SMOTE
print("Class distribution after SMOTE:", Counter(y_resampled))

Key Steps

1. TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text descriptions into numerical features.


2. SMOTE Balancing: Ensures each flavor has an equal number of descriptions.


3. Conversion Back to DataFrame: Keeps flavors with their newly generated data points.



Would you like help visualizing the class distribution before and after SMOTE?

The error occurs because SMOTE requires at least n_neighbors + 1 samples in each class, but some flavors in your dataset have only one description. By default, SMOTE tries to generate new samples using the k=5 nearest neighbors, but if a class has only 1 sample, there aren't enough neighbors to generate synthetic data.

Fix

To resolve this, we can:

1. Use SMOTE(sampling_strategy="not majority"): Ensures only underrepresented classes are oversampled.


2. Set k_neighbors dynamically: If some classes have fewer than n_neighbors, adjust k_neighbors.


3. Use SMOTETomek or SMOTEENN: Hybrid methods handle edge cases better.


4. Use RandomOverSampler for extremely rare classes: If a class has only one sample, SMOTE cannot work, so RandomOverSampler can be an alternative.

Modified Code: Handling Rare Classes

import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample DataFrame (replace with your actual dataset)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Description': ["Sweet and tangy", "Rich and creamy", "Bitter with a hint of citrus", 
                    "Mild and smooth", "Strong and spicy", "Sweet and fruity"],  
    'Flavor': ["Citrus", "Vanilla", "Bitter", "Mild", "Spicy", "Fruity"]
})

# Assuming you have a large dataset, replace df with your actual data
X_text = df["Description"]  # Text data
y = df["Flavor"]  # Target labels (flavors)

# Convert text descriptions into numerical features using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_text)

# Check class distribution before SMOTE
print("Class distribution before SMOTE:", Counter(y))

# Get the minimum class count (excluding the majority class)
min_class_count = min(Counter(y).values())

# If any class has only 1 sample, use RandomOverSampler first
if min_class_count < 2:
    print("Using RandomOverSampler for rare classes...")
    ros = RandomOverSampler(sampling_strategy="not majority", random_state=42)
    X_vectorized, y = ros.fit_resample(X_vectorized, y)

# Apply SMOTE with adjusted k_neighbors
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy="not majority", k_neighbors=min(5, min_class_count - 1), random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_vectorized, y)

# Convert back to DataFrame
df_resampled = pd.DataFrame(X_resampled.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
df_resampled["Flavor"] = y_resampled

# Check class distribution after SMOTE
print("Class distribution after SMOTE:", Counter(y_resampled))

Key Fixes

1. RandomOverSampler for classes with 1 sample: Ensures rare classes have enough samples before SMOTE.


2. k_neighbors dynamically set: Prevents SMOTE from failing due to a lack of neighbors.


3. sampling_strategy="not majority": Only balances the minority classes without oversampling the majority class.



This should resolve the issue. Let me know if you need further tweaks!
