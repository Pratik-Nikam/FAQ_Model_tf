To apply SMOTE when you have categorical data like "Description" (text) and "Flavor" (labels), we need to:

1. Convert text descriptions into numerical features (e.g., using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer).


2. Apply SMOTE to balance the flavors.


3. Convert the oversampled data back into a usable format.



Here's how you can do it:

Applying SMOTE for Text Data

import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample DataFrame (replace with your actual dataset)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Description': ["Sweet and tangy", "Rich and creamy", "Bitter with a hint of citrus", 
                    "Mild and smooth", "Strong and spicy", "Sweet and fruity"],  
    'Flavor': ["Citrus", "Vanilla", "Bitter", "Mild", "Spicy", "Fruity"]
})

# Assuming you have a large dataset, replace df with your actual data
X_text = df["Description"]  # Text data
y = df["Flavor"]  # Target labels (flavors)

# Convert text descriptions into numerical features using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_text)

# Check class distribution before SMOTE
print("Class distribution before SMOTE:", Counter(y))

# Apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy='auto', random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_vectorized, y)

# Convert back to DataFrame
df_resampled = pd.DataFrame(X_resampled.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
df_resampled["Flavor"] = y_resampled

# Check class distribution after SMOTE
print("Class distribution after SMOTE:", Counter(y_resampled))

Key Steps

1. TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts text descriptions into numerical features.


2. SMOTE Balancing: Ensures each flavor has an equal number of descriptions.


3. Conversion Back to DataFrame: Keeps flavors with their newly generated data points.



Would you like help visualizing the class distribution before and after SMOTE?

The error occurs because SMOTE requires at least n_neighbors + 1 samples in each class, but some flavors in your dataset have only one description. By default, SMOTE tries to generate new samples using the k=5 nearest neighbors, but if a class has only 1 sample, there aren't enough neighbors to generate synthetic data.

Fix

To resolve this, we can:

1. Use SMOTE(sampling_strategy="not majority"): Ensures only underrepresented classes are oversampled.


2. Set k_neighbors dynamically: If some classes have fewer than n_neighbors, adjust k_neighbors.


3. Use SMOTETomek or SMOTEENN: Hybrid methods handle edge cases better.


4. Use RandomOverSampler for extremely rare classes: If a class has only one sample, SMOTE cannot work, so RandomOverSampler can be an alternative.

Modified Code: Handling Rare Classes

import pandas as pd
from collections import Counter
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Sample DataFrame (replace with your actual dataset)
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'Description': ["Sweet and tangy", "Rich and creamy", "Bitter with a hint of citrus", 
                    "Mild and smooth", "Strong and spicy", "Sweet and fruity"],  
    'Flavor': ["Citrus", "Vanilla", "Bitter", "Mild", "Spicy", "Fruity"]
})

# Assuming you have a large dataset, replace df with your actual data
X_text = df["Description"]  # Text data
y = df["Flavor"]  # Target labels (flavors)

# Convert text descriptions into numerical features using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X_vectorized = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_text)

# Check class distribution before SMOTE
print("Class distribution before SMOTE:", Counter(y))

# Get the minimum class count (excluding the majority class)
min_class_count = min(Counter(y).values())

# If any class has only 1 sample, use RandomOverSampler first
if min_class_count < 2:
    print("Using RandomOverSampler for rare classes...")
    ros = RandomOverSampler(sampling_strategy="not majority", random_state=42)
    X_vectorized, y = ros.fit_resample(X_vectorized, y)

# Apply SMOTE with adjusted k_neighbors
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy="not majority", k_neighbors=min(5, min_class_count - 1), random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_vectorized, y)

# Convert back to DataFrame
df_resampled = pd.DataFrame(X_resampled.toarray(), columns=vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
df_resampled["Flavor"] = y_resampled

# Check class distribution after SMOTE
print("Class distribution after SMOTE:", Counter(y_resampled))


---

Key Fixes

1. RandomOverSampler for classes with 1 sample: Ensures rare classes have enough samples before SMOTE.


2. k_neighbors dynamically set: Prevents SMOTE from failing due to a lack of neighbors.


3. sampling_strategy="not majority": Only balances the minority classes without oversampling the majority class.



This should resolve the issue. Let me know if you need further tweaks!


If you want to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system without using an LLM, you can use TF-IDF, BM25, or dense embeddings for retrieval and generate responses using simple template-based or rule-based methods. Here’s how you can do it:


---

1. Data Preparation

Ensure your FAQ dataset is structured in a format like CSV or JSON:


---

2. Retrieval Mechanisms

A. TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity

This method converts questions into vectors and retrieves the most similar one.

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Load FAQ data
faq_data = pd.read_csv("faq.csv")

# Vectorize questions
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
question_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(faq_data["Question"])

def retrieve_answer(user_query):
    query_vector = vectorizer.transform([user_query])
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_vector, question_vectors)
    best_match_idx = similarities.argmax()
    return faq_data["Answer"][best_match_idx]

# Example usage
print(retrieve_answer("How do I change my password?"))


---

B. BM25 (Better for Text Retrieval)

BM25 (from Elasticsearch or rank_bm25) retrieves FAQs based on relevance.

from rank_bm25 import BM25Okapi
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

# Preprocess data
faq_questions = faq_data["Question"].tolist()
tokenized_corpus = [word_tokenize(q.lower()) for q in faq_questions]

# Initialize BM25 model
bm25 = BM25Okapi(tokenized_corpus)

def retrieve_answer_bm25(user_query):
    query_tokens = word_tokenize(user_query.lower())
    scores = bm25.get_scores(query_tokens)
    best_match_idx = scores.argmax()
    return faq_data["Answer"][best_match_idx]

print(retrieve_answer_bm25("Can I get a refund?"))


---

C. Dense Embeddings (More Accurate)

Use Sentence-BERT (SBERT) for retrieval.

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

# Load SBERT model
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Encode FAQ questions
faq_embeddings = model.encode(faq_data["Question"].tolist(), convert_to_tensor=True)

def retrieve_answer_sbert(user_query):
    query_embedding = model.encode(user_query, convert_to_tensor=True)
    scores = util.pytorch_cos_sim(query_embedding, faq_embeddings)[0]
    best_match_idx = scores.argmax().item()
    return faq_data["Answer"][best_match_idx]

print(retrieve_answer_sbert("I forgot my password, what should I do?"))


---

3. Generation without LLM

Since you're not using an LLM, you can:

Return the exact answer from the FAQ.

Use templates for dynamic responses:


def generate_response(answer):
    return f"Sure! Here’s what I found: {answer}"


---

4. Deployment

Use Flask or FastAPI to create an API.

Store embeddings in FAISS or Weaviate for fast retrieval.

Deploy on AWS/GCP/Azure.
