1. Deep Neural Networks Fundamentals:

a) Neural Network Basics:
- Neurons: Basic computational units that:
  * Receive inputs
  * Apply weights and biases
  * Pass through an activation function
  * Produce output
- Layers: Groups of neurons
  * Input Layer: Receives raw data
  * Hidden Layers: Process information
  * Output Layer: Produces final predictions

b) Activation Functions:
- ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit): 
  * Most commonly used
  * f(x) = max(0, x)
  * Helps with vanishing gradient problem
- Sigmoid: 
  * Used in output layer for multi-label classification
  * Maps outputs to [0,1] range
  * f(x) = 1/(1 + e^-x)

2. Text Processing Deep Dive:

a) Tokenization:
```python
# Example text
text = "The quick brown fox"

# After tokenization
tokens = ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox"]

# After integer encoding
encoded = [45, 182, 94, 267]  # Example indices
```

b) Word Embeddings:
- Dense vector representation of words
- Similar words have similar vectors
```
"king"  -> [0.2, -0.5, 0.1, 0.8]
"queen" -> [0.2, -0.4, 0.1, 0.7]
"dog"   -> [-0.4, 0.2, -0.3, 0.1]
```

3. LSTM Architecture in Detail:

a) LSTM Cell Structure:
```
Input Gate (i):
- Controls what new information to store
σ(Wi[ht-1, xt] + bi)

Forget Gate (f):
- Controls what information to throw away
σ(Wf[ht-1, xt] + bf)

Cell State (C):
- Long-term memory
Ct = ft * Ct-1 + it * tanh(Wc[ht-1, xt] + bc)

Output Gate (o):
- Controls what parts of cell state to output
ht = ot * tanh(Ct)
```

b) Bidirectional LSTM:
- Processes sequence in both directions
- Forward LSTM: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] →
- Backward LSTM: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] ←
- Combines both for richer representation

4. Transformer Architecture Detailed:

a) Multi-Head Attention:
```
Q (Query), K (Key), V (Value) matrices
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T/√dk)V

Multiple heads allow attending to different parts:
head_i = Attention(QWi_q, KWi_k, VWi_v)
MultiHead = Concat(head_1, ..., head_h)W_o
```

b) Position-wise Feed-Forward:
```python
FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2
```

5. Training Process Detailed:

a) Forward Pass:
```python
# Example with single sample
description_input = "Fix system error"
resolution_input = "Restart service"

# Vectorization
desc_vec = vectorizer(description_input)  # [45, 82, 123]
res_vec = vectorizer(resolution_input)    # [67, 91]

# Embedding
desc_emb = embedding_layer(desc_vec)  # Shape: [seq_len, emb_dim]
res_emb = embedding_layer(res_vec)    # Shape: [seq_len, emb_dim]

# LSTM Processing
desc_features = lstm_layer(desc_emb)  # Shape: [hidden_size]
res_features = lstm_layer(res_emb)    # Shape: [hidden_size]

# Final Prediction
prediction = dense_layer(combined_features)  # Shape: [num_labels]
```

b) Backpropagation:
- Calculates gradients of loss with respect to weights
- Uses chain rule to propagate error backwards
```python
# Simplified example
loss = binary_crossentropy(true_labels, predictions)
gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
```

6. Your Model's Architecture:

a) Training Phase Architecture:
```
Description Input → TextVectorization → Embedding
                                          ↓
                                    LSTM/Transformer
                                          ↓
                                    Dense Features
                                          ↓
Resolution Input → TextVectorization → Embedding    
                                          ↓          
                                    LSTM/Transformer
                                          ↓
                                    Dense Features
                                          ↓
                                Attention Mechanism
                                          ↓
                                 Classification Layer
```

b) Loss Function (Binary Crossentropy):
```python
BCE = -Σ(y_true * log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * log(1 - y_pred))
```

7. Key Hyperparameters Impact:

a) Embedding Dimension (128):
- Too small: Can't capture word relationships
- Too large: Overfitting, slower training
- 128 is good balance for medium vocabulary

b) LSTM Units (64):
- Controls model's memory capacity
- More units = more complex patterns
- But also more parameters to train

c) Batch Size (32):
- Smaller: More frequent updates, more noise
- Larger: Stable updates, more memory needed
- 32 is common sweet spot

d) Learning Rate:
- Too high: Unstable training
- Too low: Slow convergence
- Adam optimizer helps adapt automatically
