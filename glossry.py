1. Basic Concepts:

- Text Classification: Process of assigning predefined categories/labels to text documents
- Multi-label Classification: When each text can belong to multiple categories simultaneously (like your case where a description can have multiple flavors)
- Neural Networks: Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks that learn to perform tasks by considering examples

2. Data Preprocessing Terms:

- Vectorization: Converting text into numbers that neural networks can process
  - TextVectorization layer: Keras layer that handles:
    - Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words/tokens
    - Vocabulary creation: Creating a dictionary of unique words
    - Integer encoding: Converting words to numbers
  - Embedding: Converting words to dense vectors of fixed size where similar words have similar vectors
    - embedding_dim: Size of the vector space (e.g., 128 means each word becomes a vector of 128 numbers)
    - vocab_size: Maximum number of words to keep in vocabulary

3. Model Architectures:

a) LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):
- Type of RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) that can learn long-term dependencies
- Key components:
  - Memory cell: Stores information over time
  - Gates: Control information flow
    - Input gate: What new information to store
    - Forget gate: What information to throw away
    - Output gate: What information to use
- Bidirectional LSTM: Processes sequence in both directions
  - lstm_units: Number of LSTM cells (e.g., 64)

b) Transformer:
- Modern architecture that uses attention mechanism
- Components:
  - Multi-Head Attention: Allows model to focus on different parts of input
    - num_heads: Number of attention mechanisms (e.g., 8)
  - Feed-Forward Network: Processes attended information
    - ff_dim: Size of feed-forward layers (e.g., 128)
  - Layer Normalization: Stabilizes training
  - Position Embeddings: Adds position information to tokens

4. Model Parameters:

- max_length: Maximum length of input text sequence (e.g., 128 tokens)
- batch_size: Number of samples processed before model update (e.g., 32)
- epochs: Number of complete passes through training data
- learning_rate: How much to adjust model in response to errors (controlled by Adam optimizer)

5. Keras Concepts:

- Sequential API: Linear stack of layers
- Functional API: More flexible, allows multiple inputs/outputs
- Layer Types:
  - Dense: Fully connected neural network layer
  - Dropout: Randomly deactivates neurons to prevent overfitting
  - LayerNormalization: Normalizes layer inputs for stable training
  - GlobalAveragePooling: Reduces sequence to fixed-size by averaging
  - Embedding: Converts integer indices to dense vectors

6. Loss and Metrics:

- Binary Crossentropy: Loss function for multi-label classification
- Binary Accuracy: Percentage of correct predictions
- Adam Optimizer: Advanced gradient descent algorithm that adapts learning rates

7. Training Process:

- Forward Pass: Model makes predictions
- Loss Calculation: Measures prediction errors
- Backpropagation: Calculates gradients
- Weight Updates: Adjusts model parameters to reduce errors

8. Data Management:

- tf.data.Dataset: Efficient data pipeline
- Batching: Groups samples for parallel processing
- Shuffling: Randomizes data order
- Prefetching: Loads next batch while processing current one
