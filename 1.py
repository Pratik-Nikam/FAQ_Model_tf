Based on your project requirements for developing two machine learning models—one for support ticket categorization and another for issue identification and resolution guidance—here are the detailed specifications:


---

1. Model Requirements

Model 1: Support Ticket Categorization

Methodology: Implement a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification of support tickets.

Calculation Approach: The model will process textual descriptions of support tickets, converting them into numerical representations through techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization. These vectors will serve as input features for the neural network, which will output probabilities corresponding to predefined ticket categories.

Modeling Assumptions:

Each support ticket belongs to one distinct category.

The textual descriptions provide sufficient information for accurate classification.


Structure:

Input Layer: Accepts TF-IDF vectors representing ticket descriptions.

Hidden Layers: Multiple dense layers with ReLU activation functions to capture complex patterns in the data.

Output Layer: A softmax layer that outputs probability distributions over the possible categories.


Output: The model will output a category label for each support ticket, indicating its classification.

Performance Metrics: The model's performance will be evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robust classification capabilities.


Model 2: Issue Identification and Resolution Guidance

Methodology: Utilize a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, fine-tuned for the specific task of issue identification and resolution guidance.

Calculation Approach: The model will analyze both the support ticket descriptions and associated metadata to generate contextual embeddings. These embeddings will be used to identify the core issue and suggest potential resolutions by comparing them to a database of historical ticket resolutions.

Modeling Assumptions:

Historical ticket data contains relevant information for resolving current issues.

The language and structure of ticket descriptions are consistent with the data used for fine-tuning the model.


Structure:

Input Layer: Processes raw text from ticket descriptions and metadata.

Transformer Layers: Multiple layers that capture contextual relationships within the text.

Output Layer: Generates embeddings that can be used to retrieve or suggest relevant resolutions.


Output: For each support ticket, the model will provide a suggested resolution or a set of potential solutions ranked by relevance.

Performance Metrics: Evaluation will be based on metrics such as BLEU score, ROUGE score, and F1-score to assess the quality and relevance of the suggested resolutions.

2. Data Requirements

Training Data:

Model 1:

Data Source: Historical support tickets with labeled categories.

Data Description: Textual descriptions of support tickets along with their corresponding category labels.

Data Volume: A substantial dataset comprising thousands of tickets to ensure model robustness.

Data Sensitivity: No Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is included.


Model 2:

Data Source: Historical support tickets accompanied by detailed resolution steps and metadata.

Data Description: Comprehensive text data detailing the issues reported and the resolutions provided, along with any relevant metadata.

Data Volume: A large dataset to capture a wide range of issues and their corresponding solutions.

Data Sensitivity: No PII is included.



Anticipated Output and Uncertainty:

Model 1: The model will output a single category label for each support ticket. While high accuracy is expected, there may be instances where the model's prediction does not align with the actual category due to nuances in language or insufficient information in the ticket description.

Model 2: The model will provide suggested resolutions for support tickets. The suggestions are based on patterns learned from historical data and may not cover novel or unprecedented issues. The confidence in the suggestions will vary depending on the similarity between the current ticket and past cases.


Data Sharing:

No data will be shared with external vendors. All data processing and model training will be conducted internally, ensuring data security and compliance with organizational policies.

3. Technical Requirements

Implementation:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries and Frameworks:

TensorFlow and Keras for model development and training.

Hugging Face Transformers for leveraging pre-trained BERT models.

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and preprocessing.

Scikit-learn for evaluation metrics and additional utilities.



Hardware and Infrastructure:

Computing Resources: Access to high-performance GPUs to expedite model training and inference, especially for the transformer-based Model 2.

Storage: Sufficient storage solutions to handle large datasets and model artifacts securely.


Software and Platforms:

Development Environment: Utilization of Jupyter Notebooks or integrated development environments (IDEs) for code development and experimentation.

Version Control: Implementation of Git for version control to manage code changes and collaboration.

Deployment: Models will be deployed as RESTful APIs using frameworks such as Flask or FastAPI, facilitating integration with existing support systems.


Open Source and Vendor Software:

Open Source Software: The project will leverage open-source libraries and frameworks as mentioned above. All utilized open-source software will be vetted to ensure compliance with organizational policies and to mitigate potential security risks.

Vendor Software: No proprietary vendor software will be used in this project.
